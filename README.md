# dhtmlx-json-node

This is a short tutorial to set up dhtmlx (dhx) using only JSON and node/mongodb as a back-end and the REST API. Recently I followed the ['Your First App'](https://docs.dhtmlx.com/tutorials__first_app__index.html) tutorial and felt unsatisfied with what I've learned. So I decided to push a little harder and use a demo app ['CRM System'](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/demoApps/dhtmlxCRMSystem/index.html) as the base.

# Plan
  - [ ] Create static html page in Node
  - [ ] Get dhx up and running
  - [ ] Initialize the layout, grid and form with static data
  - [ ] Create and connect REST API

# Step 1: Static node web server

# Step 2: Get dhx up and running

# Step 3: Initialize the layout, grid and form with static data

# Step 4: Create and connect REST API
